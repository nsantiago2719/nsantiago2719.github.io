            I mainly use AWS("Amazon Web Service") as my cloud provider for day to day job but I also have some experience in
            Google Cloud Platform and Digital Ocean. I have been using AWS for quite a while now and I can say that I've immersed
            myself into it unlike to the other cloud providers. Basically I'm more focused into cloud security and it's architecture
            as I believe that it is one of the vital parts of a platform. Building reputation and trust to your end users can take
            more than a decade but it can only take a few minutes to ruin it.

          <p class="card-content">
            I have learned a couple of programming language before I started working as a professional and one of them is Ruby along with the famous
            MVC framework Ruby on Rails or so called RoR. I landed my first job as a Junior Rails Developer and that takes me to journey to the cloud.
            Along that journey I started getting curious on other languages like Python, Go and Javascript. Right now I rarely use Ruby and mostly uses
            Go for my day to day job. As most of the experienced software engineers I've encountered they always say every language is different,
            the question is when to use them.

            Since DevOps is on the rise for the past years and still continuing to the years to come I've encountered the words like
            "Infrastructre as a Code" or even "Configuration as a Code". My day to day also involves some the tools for this like Terraform and
            Cloudformation which is a tool for "Infrastructure as a Code. I admit that Terraform is easier than Cloudformation but there are use cases I guess.
            On the future I would like to use some tools like Chef, Puppet or Ansible as they for "Configuration as a Code" not for "Infrastructure as a Code".

            DevOps Beliefs & Philosophy

          <p class="card-content">
            Through out the years that I have been working immersed on the word DevOps that I it have as my career, I have encountered some
            misconceptions and bad practices about it that goes different from what I've read and learned. In my opinion and perspective, for the
            company to have a "true DevOps" implemented they should have single common goal which brings to my Philosophies and Beliefs.

            <strong>Philosophies</strong>
            <ul class="pandb">
              <li>the Team should have a once common goal. Which is to run and serve a service that has a good quality for the end-user.</li>
              <li>teamwork should be observed and strictly must have.</li>
              <li>never forget to always learn and improve the existing process/system/culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Beliefs</strong>
            <ul class="pandb">
              <li>in my own definition, DevOps is the by product of the company's effort to deliver the good quality product to their end-users.</li>
              <li>to add, by aiming to have "true DevOps" it will grant the company a big change that can improve its performance.</li>
              <li>lastly, once a "true DevOps" is achieved the end-users will be delighted for the quality of the service they are receiving.</li>
